Biochemistry: 
    Ligation->equired mass insert (g) = desired insert/vector molar ratio x mass of vector (g) x ratio of insert to vector lengths
    DNA mass mole->moles dsDNA (mol) = mass of dsDNA (g)/((length of dsDNA (bp) x 617.96 g/mol) + 36.04 g/mol)
                    moles of dsDNA ends = moles dsDNA (mol) x 2
                    DNA copy number = moles of dsDNA x 6.022e23 molecules/mol
                    moles ssDNA (mol) = mass of ssDNA (g)/((length of ssDNA (nt) x 308.97 g/mol) + 18.02 g/mol)
                    moles of ssDNA ends = moles ssDNA (mol)
                    DNA copy number = moles of ssDNA x 6.022e23 molecules/mol
                    moles ssRNA (mol) = mass of ssRNA (g)/((length of ssRNA (nt) x 321.47 g/mol) + 18.02 g/mol)
                    moles of ssRNA ends = moles ssRNA (mol)
                    RNA copy number = moles of ssRNA x 6.022e23 molecules/mol
    DNA ends mole->moles of dsDNA ends = mass of dsDNA (g)/((length of dsDNA (bp) x 617.96 g/mol) + 36.04 g/mol) x 2
    nucleic acid conc->concentration (ug/ml) = OD260 x conversion factor
                    conversion factors:
                    1 OD260 Unit = 50 μg/ml for dsDNA
                    1   OD260 Unit = 40 μg/ml ssRNA
                    1 OD260 Unit = 33 μg/ml ssDNA
                    ss oligo concentration (ug/ml) = OD260 x MW x 1000 / ε260
                    where MW = molecular weight of oligo (non-phosphorylated)
                    and ε260 = extinction coefficient of oligo at 260nm
    Dilution cal->required stock solution (L) = desired final concentration (mol/L) / stock solution concentration (mol/L) x total final solution volume (L)
